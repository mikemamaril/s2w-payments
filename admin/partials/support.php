		My plugin can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/mikemamaril/s2w-payments" target="_blank">https://github.com/mikemamaril/s2w-payments</a> where you can find issues, send feature requests among other things. This plugin is provided free of charge and has no warranties or dedicated support. I will do my best to fix any bugs or update the code when my schedule allows. Though I hope this helped you, a small business owner in one way or another.
